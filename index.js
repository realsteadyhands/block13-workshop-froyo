const description = 

//! Prompt the user for froyo flavors and store their input



//! Parse the user input into an array of froyo flavors



//! Build an object to track which flavors you have counted so far



//! Object to be updated through the array of flavors




// ! TO DO

// Student repo contains multiple commits with descriptive messages.
// The repo contains an HTML file and a connected JS file.
// The user is prompted for froyo flavors upon entering the website.
// The user's input string is split into an array of strings.
// A loop is used to iterate through the array of flavors.
// An object is used to keep count of how many orders there are of each flavor.
// The program correctly counts the number of each flavor in the user's input.
// The logic for counting the frequencies of elements in an array is organized into a function that returns an object.
// Variables and functions have meaningful names.
// The console output changes depending on the user's input.
